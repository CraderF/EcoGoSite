        <h1>EcoGo Bottle Discription</h1>
        <p>Our EcoGo water bottle is an enviormentally friendly water bottle with an 
            integrated filtration system. This bottle is designed to reduce reliance 
            on single-use plastics while providing safe, clean, and reliable drinking 
            water on the go. The bottle has an advanced filtration system that removes 
            contaminants and ensures safe drinking water. It is durable, eco-friendly, 
            and is made of reusable materials to promote sustainability. The water bottle 
            is designed to be compact and lightweight for portability and convenience. 
            It's easy to use functionality for filling, filtering, and drinking makes 
            this the optimal water bottle.</p>
        <h1>Environmental Impact</h1>
        <p>Plastic water bottles have a significant negative environmental 
            impact due to the large amount of fossil fuels used in their production, 
            the generation of plastic waste that often ends up in landfills and waterways, 
            and the potential for microplastic pollution when they break down, harming 
            marine life and ecosystems; essentially, their entire life cycle contributes 
            to climate change and pollution.</p>
        <p>Reusable water bottles help the environment by reducing plastic waste, greenhouse 
            gas emissions, and pollution. One person using a reusable water bottle instead 
            of single-use bottles can prevent hundreds of bottles from ending up in landfills 
            each year. Reusing a bottle instead of buying a new one can significantly reduce 
            energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Reusable bottles can also help reduce 
            microplastics in the air and oceans, and stormwater pollution.</p>
